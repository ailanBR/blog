# Hi
 
# Career

My adventure in the coding word started with a phrase that has been with me all my life `If someone else did, why can't I ?`, after a long time playing one of the various Ragnarok private servers I decided to create my own, before I realised, I was eating tutorials like crazy and my own Ragnarok Private server was born `MetalicRO` !

As a professional, after my graduation, I started with a language that came from the age of dinosaurs [Cobol](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL) in a big company [Capgemini](https://www.capgemini.com/?georedirect_none=true#) in the world of banking helping projects related to loan analytics for the [Bradesco](https://banco.bradesco/html/classic/index.shtm).
After that I was hire to work in the [AmbevTech](https://www.ambevtech.com.br/) stated using the same language but migrated to `.Net C#` and after some years I decided to come back to the banking environment at [Nubank](https://nubank.com.br/en/) in the functional programming world with my currently favorite programming language [Clojure](https://clojure.org/).
